We write test to make sure our code work as expected, no matter that a Go code or YAML config. In this series, we will 
show how we develop and do integration tests using local k8s. The first part will show how we simulate the HTTPS certificate issue 
flow to allow our Platform engineers to test their config and allow our Front-end engineers to connect their application 
to local server with a self-signed HTTPS certificate.  

#### Let’s Encrypt ACME & HTTP-01 challenge for dummy
Let's Encrypt is an internet goodie. Talk to them nicely, and they will give you a free HTTPS certificate. We're using 
cert-manager to speak to them, the process can simplify as:
- **You**: buy and then point `example.com` to your server.
- **Our cert-manager** (via API requests): Hello Mr. Let's Encrypt, can I have a free HTTPS certificate do my `example.com` domain?
- **Let's Encrypt** (via API responses): Sure thing! But first, I need to know if you owned `example.com.` Here I have a secure-random-token, put this secure-random-token to this path `http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/<SECURE-RANDOM-TOKEN>` and make sure I can access and view it.
- **Our cert-manager**: It is done, sir, can you check?
- **Let's Encrypt**: Open `http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/<SECURE-RANDOM-TOKEN>` in my browser. It seems legit. OK, here is the key for your HTTPS certificate.

Let's Encrypt provide a better description or you can read the RFC 8555 for not so dummy:
- https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge
- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-4

#### Setup your minikube
*Example code at the end of the post*.  
Cert-manager have a great tutorial here:
- https://cert-manager.io/docs/tutorials/acme/nginx-ingress/#step-2---deploy-the-nginx-ingress-controller

You should follow the post. They provide many explanations.  
Their post assumes you're testing on a real k8s cluster (GKE or any public cloud provider offers some free resource for testing). 
Our post is for minikube. Some dependencies required:  

- minikube (we're using v1.24.0)
- helm (v3.7.0)
```bash
minikube start # then wait
minikube addons enable ingress
# you can find this kuard.yaml in examples folder of this post
kubectl apply -f ./examples/kuard.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./examples/http-only-ingress.yaml
```
Everything should work as expected. Note that we install everything in the same namespace for the simplicity of the post.  
Run `kubectl get pod -n default`, and you should get everything ready and running like this:
```
kuard-5cd5556bc9-kxt6p                                 1/1     Running   0          14m
```
Checking the network services created by `kubectl get svc -n default`:
```
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
kuard        ClusterIP      10.101.81.156   <none>        80/TCP                       22m
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP                      61m

```
Also, we should check the ingress by `kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx`:
```
NAME                                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
ingress-nginx-controller             NodePort    10.99.82.10      <none>        80:31563/TCP,443:30703/TCP   4m39s
ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP   10.111.186.145   <none>        443/TCP                      4m39s
```
We have:
- kuard: for the demo application
- ingress-nginx: play the role of network LoadBalancer for your cluster

If you're working with a cluster on GKE or EKS, they will create a real IP, a network LB and assign that to your cluster.  

Then you can test the thing out with `curl -H 'Host: example.example.com' "http://$(minikube ip)"` to check the output.  
Above command is equivalent with you modifying your `hosts` file to access localhost via example.example.com in browser.  
Next, let install cert-manager in the same namespace:  
```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --version v1.6.0 --set installCRDs=true
```
Check if stuff installed correctly:
```
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-6c576bddcf-hjdts                          1/1     Running   0          32m
cert-manager-cainjector-669c966b86-ggs9v               1/1     Running   0          32m
cert-manager-webhook-7d6cf57d55-mchqj                  1/1     Running   0          32m
kuard-5cd5556bc9-kxt6p                                 1/1     Running   0          46m
```
Normally, if you are on a real cluster, you can create an `Issuer` object point to Let's Encrypt staging environment like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
    name: letsencrypt-staging
spec:
    acme:
    # The ACME server URL
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # Email address used for ACME registration
    email: user@example.com
    # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key
    privateKeySecretRef:
        name: letsencrypt-staging
    # Enable the HTTP-01 challenge provider
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
            class:  nginx
```
Based on this configuration, cert-manager will speak to Let's Encrypt (staging in this case) to get the certificate.  
But Let's Encrypt cannot access your server since everything is just your local IP. Also, the staging environment has 
some kind of rate limit. You cannot use it if your CI/CD runs really frequently.  
One solution for this, believe it or not, is to deploy your own fake Let's Encrypt to simulate the flow.  

#### Introducing Pebble
https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble
> A miniature version of Boulder, Pebble is a small ACME test server not suited for use as a production CA.

We have prepared for you a minimal installation of Pebble already (link at the end of post).  
Let's install it in another namespace to simulate a different network :joy:
```
kubectl create ns emulator
kubectl apply -f ./examples/pebble.yaml -n emulator
kubectl get pod -n emulator
```
and if everything run normally:
```
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pebble-885bdd44c-cpv6r   1/1     Running   0          19s
```
Now go back to default namespace and install the issuer point to our local Pebble:
- kubectl apply -f ./examples/pebble-issuer.yaml -n default
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: pebble-issuer
spec:
  acme:
    skipTLSVerify: true
    email: example@example.com
    server: https://pebble.emulator:14000/dir
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: pk-pebble-issuer
    solvers:
      - selector:
        http01:
          ingress:
            class: nginx
```
Chicken and eggs issue here, our Pebble itself don't have valid cert =]] so we `skipTLSVerify: true`.  
The `server` now pointed to `pebble` service an `emulator` namespace.  
We should check if the issuer config correctly by `kubectl get issuer`:
```
NAME            READY   AGE
pebble-issuer   True    10s
```
We should modify the installed http-only-ingress to have https:
`kubectl apply -f ./examples/https-ingress.yaml`, you can see:
- kubectl get svc
```
NAME                        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
cert-manager                ClusterIP      10.108.69.104   <none>          9402/TCP                     135m
cert-manager-webhook        ClusterIP      10.98.30.215    <none>          443/TCP                      135m
cm-acme-http-solver-8fm5v   NodePort       10.103.74.213   <none>          8089:30783/TCP               24m
kuard                       ClusterIP      10.101.81.156   <none>          80/TCP                       149m
```
cert-manager create a new `cm-acme-http-solver` service to handle the challenge verification, let check the challenge:  
- kubectl get challenge
```
NAME                                           STATE     DOMAIN                AGE
quickstart-example-tls-rbxhn-3378267180-4102043678   pending   example.example.com   3m43s
```
- kubectl describe challenge quickstart-example-tls-rbxhn-3378267180-4102043678
```

```
Hmmm, I forgot. Still, the `example.example.com` is just a fake domain. Another hack is needed for this blog post.  
We can modify the CoreDNS config so the internal cluster can resolve to our internal IP. I call this a good hack 
because it's similar to how the domain owner needs to point the domain to the server's IP.
I hope that when some one reading this post, k8s still use `CoreDNS` and installed it in the `kube-system` namespace: 
- kubectl -n kube-system describe configmap coredns

You will see the config file somewhat like what we're trying to modify below
```bash
ip=$(kubectl get svc ingress-nginx-controller --no-headers -n ingress-nginx | awk '{print$3}')
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: coredns
  namespace: kube-system
apiVersion: v1
data:
  Corefile: |
    .:53 {
        errors
        health {
           lameduck 5s
        }
        ready
        kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
           pods insecure
           fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
           ttl 30
        }
        prometheus :9153
        forward . 1.1.1.1
        cache 30
        loop
        reload
        loadbalance
    }
    example.example.com {
       hosts {
         $ip example.example.com
         fallthrough
       }
       whoami
    }
EOF
  kubectl delete pod -n kube-system --wait $(kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep coredns | awk '{print$1}')
```
Delete everything (just for make sure):
```bash
kubectl delete -f ./examples/https-ingress.yaml
kubectl delete -f ./examples/pebble-issuer.yaml
kubectl delete -f ./examples/pebble.yaml -n emulator
```
and try again:
```bash
kubectl apply -f ./examples/pebble.yaml -n emulator
kubectl apply -f ./examples/pebble-issuer.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./examples/https-ingress.yaml
```
Applying the new ingress with correct annotation will trigger a webhook to create new certificate (you can check for resources like Cert, Order, Challenge... status)
```yaml
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"    
    cert-manager.io/issuer: "pebble-issuer"
```
- kubectl get order
```
NAME                                      STATE   AGE
quickstart-example-tls-7k6zs-3378267180   valid   41s
```
- kubectl get cert
```
NAME                     READY   SECRET                   AGE
quickstart-example-tls   True    quickstart-example-tls   37s
```
Now let try to dial with HTTPS:
```bash
curl -H 'Host: example.example.com' https://$(minikube ip)
```
We should see some error:
```
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
```
When you make HTTPS requests, the process invokes much more complex steps. The OS or browser use a pre-installed certificate 
to validate your server cert - one of them is Let's Encrypt root cert, and of course, our pebble install have a test cert 
no one trust (no one should trust the cert using in this example - if you're not lazy like me, generate your own).  
For now, just add an option to ignore the validation `curl -k -H 'Host: example.example.com' https://$(minikube ip)` and 
you will see some HTML.

#### Testing things in your browser
For this, you need to modify your host's files to point the domain to `minikube ip`.  
We need to get the intermediate cert and use it to make the call successful:
```
kubectl exec -n emulator deploy/pebble -- sh -c "apk add curl > /dev/null; curl -ksS https://localhost:15000/intermediates/0" > pebble.intermediate.pem.crt
curl --cacert pebble.intermediate.pem.crt -v https://example.example.com
```
And you should see some HTML. If you really want to, you can add the certificate to your chrome via:
- Settings > Privacy and security > Security > Manage certificates > Authorities tab

Choose the option for using it to verify the website, then you finally can access https://example.example.com without 
a red warning, remember to remove that cert after you finish testing.  
#### Too much for a post already
I admit that a lot of effort just for preparing this, Pebble provide you tool to inject some chaos into the flow and 
designed for cert-manager and other competing teams to test their ACME client implementation.  
For our team, we need to spend time (mostly writing bash script) to make this process of setting up a new 
local cluster with only one command, and we have chance to testing out many different Ingress implementations
(actually we're using Istio Gateway).  
We see this as an opportunity to simulate the production environment, bring the 
development closer to the production environment and it is worth every single line of code.   

Almost forgot to add link to example here:
